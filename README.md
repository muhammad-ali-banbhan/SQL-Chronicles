# SQL-Chronicles
My journey through the world of SQL, documenting my learning, practice queries, and projects. From basic syntax to advanced concepts, this repository chronicles my progress.

# SQL Chronicles üöÄ

Welcome to my SQL Chronicles! This repository serves as a personal log of my journey into the fascinating world of Structured Query Language (SQL). Here, I'll be documenting my learning process, practicing various SQL concepts, and solving real-world data challenges.

My goal is to build a strong foundation in SQL, working through different phases and tackling problems with various datasets. This is my comeback story, leaving procrastination behind and fully diving into mastering data.

### Learning Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

I'm following a structured SQL learning roadmap (inspired by industry experts) to ensure comprehensive coverage. My learning path includes:

**Phase 1: Basic SQL Syntax & Foundations**
- `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`
- `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`
- `DISTINCT`, `IS NULL`
- `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- `CASE` Statements
- Date Functions (`DATEDIFF`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, etc.)
- Scalar Subqueries

**Phase 2: Combining Tables**
- `INNER JOIN` (Currently focusing here!)
- `LEFT JOIN`
- `RIGHT JOIN`
- `FULL OUTER JOIN`
- `SELF JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`
- `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `EXCEPT`, `INTERSECT`

_...and more advanced topics like Window Functions, CTEs, and Data Manipulation to come!_

### How This Repo is Organized üìÇ

All my SQL practice queries and solutions are stored within a single, organized folder.

- **`sql_practice_queries/`**: This folder contains all my `.sql` files, numbered sequentially to reflect my learning progression. Each file focuses on specific concepts or challenges faced during my daily practice.

### Datasets Used üìä

I'm practicing with a variety of datasets to gain diverse experience:

- `orders`
- `orderdetails`
- `products`
- `customers`
- `employees`
- `company` (my own created dataset)
- `movies` (Kaggle dataset)
- `student_depression` (Kaggle dataset - _though currently facing import issues, may be used later_)

### Stay Tuned! ‚ú®

This repository will be updated regularly as I progress through the SQL learning roadmap. Feel free to explore my queries, provide feedback, or connect if you're on a similar learning journey!
